Good news everyone!

I'm finally getting around to the task of refactoring the code (and making successful modifications that don't break the existing code). Today I've abstracted out the windowing procedures, mouse/keyboard input and the like. This will come in handy one day if we wish to support touch screens, web browser etc.

Tomorrow I start extracting away all the ugly native graphics calls that are riddled all over the place, to make the code easier to read and more portable, hopefully.

I'm going to try my best to finish any cleaning necessary and publish the project source entirely. That way, all you programmers out there can start experimenting with it and contribute.

Until next time..
